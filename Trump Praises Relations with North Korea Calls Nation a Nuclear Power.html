        <p><strong>Washington D.C., March 14, 2025</strong> – Former U.S. President Donald Trump has once again sparked global debate by stating that he maintains “good relations” with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and acknowledging North Korea as a “nuclear
            power.”</p>

        <p>During a press briefing at his residence in Florida, Trump remarked, “I had a great relationship with Kim. We understood each other, and there was peace during my time in office.” He added that "North Korea is a nuclear power, whether people like
            it or not," emphasizing the need for diplomatic engagement rather than confrontation.</p>

        <h2>North Korea’s Nuclear Status Sparks Concerns</h2>
        <p>Trump’s statement comes at a time when global tensions regarding nuclear weapons remain high. North Korea has continued missile tests despite international sanctions, and recent intelligence suggests advancements in its long-range ballistic missile
            program.</p>
        <p>His acknowledgment of North Korea’s nuclear status has raised eyebrows in Washington and among U.S. allies. The Biden administration has remained firm in its stance that North Korea must denuclearize before any formal diplomatic agreements can
            be reached.</p>

        <h2>Republican and Democratic Leaders React</h2>
        <p>Trump’s remarks have received mixed reactions in the U.S. political landscape:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Republican Senator Josh Hawley</strong> supported Trump’s approach, stating, “Diplomacy is key, and Trump’s relationship with North Korea prevented war.”</li>
            <li><strong>Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders</strong> criticized the statement, calling it “reckless” and warning that it “undermines international efforts to curb nuclear proliferation.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>North Korea Yet to Respond</h2>
        <p>As of now, North Korea has not officially responded to Trump’s comments. However, past statements from Pyongyang have expressed a preference for Trump over other U.S. leaders due to his direct diplomacy style.</p>

        <p>The situation remains fluid, and geopolitical experts warn that any normalization of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities could have significant consequences for U.S.-Asia relations, South Korea’s security, and global nuclear disarmament efforts.</p>
