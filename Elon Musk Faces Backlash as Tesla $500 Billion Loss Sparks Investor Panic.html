        <p><strong>February 26, 2025</strong> – As Tesla's market value plummets by $500 billion, CEO Elon Musk finds himself at the center of controversy. Once hailed as a visionary, Musk is now facing mounting pressure from investors, analysts, and Tesla
            employees, who blame his political involvement and risky decisions for the company's steep decline.</p>

        <h2>Musk’s Political Ties and Investor Concerns</h2>
        <p>Musk’s close association with former President Donald Trump and his controversial anti-union stance have triggered backlash. Major Tesla shareholders are reportedly losing confidence, believing that his involvement in political debates is distracting
            him from leading the company.</p>

        <h2>Employee Layoffs and Supply Chain Issues</h2>
        <p>Following Tesla’s financial downturn, reports of mass layoffs have surfaced, with thousands of employees fearing job losses. Additionally, Tesla’s supply chain struggles due to competition from BYD and other Chinese EV giants have only worsened
            the situation.</p>

        <h2>Musk’s Response: A Bold Comeback Plan?</h2>
        <p>Despite the crisis, Musk remains defiant, claiming Tesla will bounce back through advanced AI-driven automation, humanoid robots, and self-driving technology. However, with Tesla’s stock plummeting to $302.80 and market analysts predicting further
            losses, the road to recovery looks increasingly uncertain.</p>

        <h2>Can Tesla Recover?</h2>
        <p>With investors growing impatient, is Elon Musk still the right leader for Tesla? Or will the company's board consider replacing him to save the brand?</p>
