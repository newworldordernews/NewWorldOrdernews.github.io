        <p>A powerful storm system, previously classified as a tropical cyclone, has battered parts of Queensland, Australia, leaving thousands of residents without electricity and causing significant disruption to daily life. The extreme weather event,
            which brought heavy rains, destructive winds, and widespread flooding, has prompted emergency responses and evacuation warnings across affected regions.</p>

        <h2>Storm Impact and Emergency Response</h2>
        <p>According to local authorities, wind speeds exceeding 120 km/h uprooted trees, damaged infrastructure, and caused road blockages. Power outages have been reported in several towns, with energy companies scrambling to restore services. Torrential
            rains have also led to flash flooding in low-lying areas, forcing families to evacuate their homes.</p>

        <p>Emergency services have issued warnings urging residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. Authorities have also deployed rescue teams to assist those stranded due to rising floodwaters. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has advised
            that heavy rainfall and strong winds will persist for the next 24 hours, potentially worsening the situation.</p>

        <h2>Government Response and Climate Concerns</h2>
        <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has assured Australians that the government is closely monitoring the situation and will provide necessary relief and support. He emphasized the importance of community resilience and praised the emergency responders
            working tirelessly to assist those in distress.</p>

        <p>Meteorologists have attributed the stormâ€™s intensity to changing climate patterns, warning that such extreme weather events may become more frequent. The disaster has reignited discussions on Australia's climate policies and preparedness for future
            natural calamities.</p>

        <h2>Recovery and Future Outlook</h2>
        <p>As recovery efforts begin, residents remain hopeful for swift power restoration and emergency assistance. Officials continue to assess the extent of the damage, while weather experts keep a close watch on the evolving conditions.</p>
