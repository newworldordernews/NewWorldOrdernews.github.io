        <p><strong>Stockholm, Sweden ‚Äì February 21, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>The Swedish Public Health Agency has issued new guidelines urging parents to eliminate screen time for toddlers and significantly limit it for older children. This initiative aims to combat rising concerns over children's health, including sleep
            deprivation, anxiety, and developmental challenges linked to excessive screen exposure.</p>

        <h2>New Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Under the updated guidelines, the agency advises:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No screen üëç stime</strong> for childrenüòâ under two years old.</li>
            <li><strong>A maximum of two hours</strong> per day for children aged 2-12.</li>
            <li><strong>Up to three hours</strong> per day for teenagers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These recommendations align with mounting research indicating that prolonged screen exposure can negatively affect children's cognitive, emotional, and social development.</p>

        <h2>Government Response</h2>
        <p>Public Health Minister Jakob Forssmed emphasized the urgent need for action, citing a growing "sleep crisis" among young Swedes. Reports indicate that excessive screen use contributes to poor sleep patterns, heightened anxiety, and declining mental
            well-being, particularly among adolescent girls.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWe are witnessing an alarming trend where children and teenagers are struggling with anxiety, sleep disorders, and reduced social interactions due to excessive screen time,‚Äù Forssmed stated. ‚ÄúThese new guidelines are meant to encourage healthier
            habits and ensure better long-term well-being for our younger generations.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>The Impact of Screen Addiction</h2>
        <p>A recent study by Sweden‚Äôs National Health Institute found that over 60% of children aged 6-12 exceed the recommended screen time limits, with many spending more than four to five hours daily on digital devices. Experts warn that this could lead
            to attention deficits, reduced academic performance, and even long-term mental health issues.</p>

        <h2>Parental Guidance and Public Response</h2>
        <p>While some parents support the initiative, others express concerns about feasibility, especially in an increasingly digital world. The guidelines recommend alternative activities such as outdoor play, reading, and social interactions to foster
            children's growth without excessive screen dependence.</p>
        <p>Critics argue that enforcing strict screen time rules may be challenging, particularly for working parents who rely on digital content to keep children engaged. However, health officials stress that moderation and awareness are key.</p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>The Swedish government plans to roll out public awareness campaigns and collaborate with schools to promote balanced screen use, ensuring that children develop healthier digital habits from an early age.</p>
