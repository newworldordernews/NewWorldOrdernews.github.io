        <p><strong>March 6, 2025</strong> – India experienced a day of both celebration and disgrace. While cricket fans rejoiced, a horrific crime left the nation facing international outrage.</p>

        <h2>India’s ICC Champions Trophy Victory</h2>
        <p>On March 9, 2025, India claimed a historic victory against New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai. Rohit Sharma’s composed 76 runs, along with crucial contributions from KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, secured a four-wicket win.
            India chased down 252 runs with an over to spare, ending a 12-year ICC trophy drought.</p>

        <h2>A Shameful Crime Stains the Nation’s Reputation</h2>
        <p>Just days before this triumph, a tragic crime occurred in Koppal, Karnataka, near Hampi. A 27-year-old Israeli tourist and her local guide were gang-raped by three men, while two male tourists accompanying them were assaulted. One of them drowned
            after being pushed into a canal. The brutal incident sparked outrage worldwide, drawing attention to ongoing safety concerns for women in India.</p>

        <h2>The Stark Contrast</h2>
        <p>While the nation celebrated its cricketing glory, the world witnessed India's struggle with serious societal issues. Despite the arrests of two suspects and a manhunt for the third, the incident overshadowed the joy of sporting success, casting
            a shadow over India’s global image.</p>
