        <p><strong>Rajkot, India – February 22, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>In a shocking revelation, secretly recorded videos of women in bathrooms, hospitals, and clinics are being sold online for as little as ₹2,000. This horrific breach of privacy has sparked outrage across the country, with growing demands for stricter
            digital security and justice for the victims.</p>

        <h2>Hospital in Rajkot Under Investigation</h2>
        <p>Authorities have launched an investigation into a hospital in Rajkot, where leaked footage of female patients has surfaced online. Reports indicate that hidden cameras were used to capture women in their most vulnerable moments—bathing, changing
            clothes, and undergoing medical procedures.</p>

        <h2>The Dark Reality of Digital Exploitation</h2>
        <p>Cybercrime experts warn that such incidents are not isolated. Illegal networks operate in the shadows, selling private footage of unsuspecting women on encrypted platforms, making it difficult for law enforcement to track and dismantle them.</p>
        <p>Victims often remain unaware that their personal moments have been monetized and circulated, leading to irreversible psychological trauma.</p>

        <h2>Public Outrage and Call for Action</h2>
        <p>Social media has erupted with demands for swift action, with activists urging the government to impose harsher penalties on perpetrators. Many are calling for stricter surveillance laws and the immediate shutdown of platforms facilitating these
            crimes.
