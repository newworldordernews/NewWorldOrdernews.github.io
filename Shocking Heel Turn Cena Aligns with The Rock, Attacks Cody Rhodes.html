        <p><strong>march 2, 2025</strong> – In one of the most shocking moments in WWE history, John Cena turned heel for the first time in his legendary 23-year career. At the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025, fans watched in disbelief as Cena aligned himself
            with The Rock and brutally attacked Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes after the main event.</p>

        <h2>Cena’s Betrayal Shakes the WWE Universe</h2>
        <p>After securing a hard-fought victory in the Men’s Elimination Chamber Match, Cena was set to headline WrestleMania 41 against Cody Rhodes. However, in a moment no one saw coming, The Rock’s music hit, and instead of a face-off, the two icons embraced—only
            for Cena to ambush Cody Rhodes moments later.</p>

        <p>The attack was ruthless, with Cena delivering multiple Attitude Adjustments, followed by The Rock’s Rock Bottom, leaving Rhodes battered in the ring.</p>

        <h2>Why Did Cena Turn Heel?</h2>
        <p>Speculation is running wild about Cena’s shocking decision. Many believe he is tired of being the "good guy" and sees Rhodes as an undeserving champion. Meanwhile, The Rock’s involvement hints at a larger conspiracy against the son of Dusty Rhodes.</p>

        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>With WrestleMania 41 just weeks away, Cody Rhodes is expected to respond soon. WWE officials are also teasing a major announcement regarding Cena’s actions. Fans are now wondering: Is John Cena truly a villain, or is there more to the story?</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for more updates as this explosive feud unfolds!</p>
